	Please note that for this release it is required to re-download the full SDK rather than using the "Update SDK" option in the user preferences, in order to ensure correct SDK updates with the "Update SDK" option in the future.<br /><br />
	Also worth noting in this month's release is that the bug which was limiting point lights on DirectX has finally been resolved in Krafix (see <a class="fw-bold text-light" href="https://github.com/armory3d/armory/issues/1772#issuecomment-1172971955">#1772</a>):
